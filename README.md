# PRODIGY_SD_04
Sudoku Solver A Java console application that automatically solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. The program takes a 9x9 Sudoku grid as input, fills in the missing numbers, and displays the completed puzzle. It efficiently explores possible solutions to find the correct arrangement of numbers.
How the Code Works:
Input: The Sudoku grid is represented as a 9x9 2D array with 0 for empty cells.
Backtracking Algorithm: The program recursively tries to fill the grid, backtracking when a conflict is found, until it finds a valid solution.
Output: Once solved, the program prints the completed Sudoku grid to the console. If no solution exists, it informs the user.



Example Input:
int[][] board = {
    {5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0},
    {6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0},
    {0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0},
    {8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3},
    {4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1},
    {7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6},
    {0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0},
    {0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5},
    {0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9}
};


Example Output:
